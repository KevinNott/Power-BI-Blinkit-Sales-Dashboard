# Power-BI-Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard


The project focuses on building a dynamic dashboard utilizing Power BI to analyze sales data from “Blinkit,” a popular online grocery shopping platform. This interactive dashboard will visualize various metrics using filters, charts, and key performance indicators (KPIs). 

The objective is to derive insights from sales data, focusing on items ordered, outlet performance, and customer satisfaction through ratings.



## Problem Statement

1. Understanding the Business Requirements:
- Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings.
- Deriving insights from sales data to assess overall business performance and identifying areas for improvement.

2. Data Preparation and Visualization:
- Importing data from an Excel sheet containing sales information.
- Cleaning and transforming the data if required to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
- Visualizing the data through various charts (bar charts, donut charts, line charts, etc.) to represent sales performance across different categories.

3. Interactive Dashboard Functionality:
- Building dynamic filters to allow users to interact with the data vis-a-vis specific criteria such as outlet types, fat content, and establishment years.
- Ensuring the dashboard responds to user input smoothly, updating visualizations based on selections.

4. Deployment of the Reporting Tool:
- Finalizing the report to be accessible in Power BI, allowing stakeholders to derive insights easily.
- Documenting the process and insights gained through the dashboard for future reference.



### Steps followed 

Step 1: Requirement Gathering
Before diving into the data, we need to establish clear business requirements.This step involves:

- Identifying KPIs relevant for performance analysis:
     - Total Sales: Overall revenue generated.
     - Average Sales: Revenue per sale.
     - Number of Items Sold: Count of all items sold.
     - Average Rating: Customer ratings of the items.

Step 2: Data Overview
The data will be sourced from an Excel sheet containing 8,500 rows of sales-related data. The columns will include:

- Item Fat Content: Classification of products.
- Sales: Revenue from sales.
- Item Type: Type of the sold items.
- Outlet Location: Location of the outlet where the sales were made.
- Establishment Year: Year when each outlet was established.

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Quality Check
Upon accessing the data:

- Validate the accuracy by checking for discrepancies, nulls, and formatting errors.
- Perform necessary data transformations using Power Query to clean the dataset.
- Replace any improperly formatted entries (like ‘LF’ instead of ‘low fat’, etc.).
- Check and ensure all necessary fields are complete without missing values.

Step 4: Designing the Dashboard
1. Setting Up Power BI: Launch Power BI and import the cleaned dataset.
2. Creating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
  - Create individual KPI visuals for total sales, average sales, number of items, and average ratings using card visuals.
  - Format each KPI to match Blinkit’s branding colors (yellow and green).
3. Building Interactive Filters:

Create slicers for filtering the data based on factors such as:
 - Fat content (low fat, regular fat).
- Type of items (fruits, vegetable, snacks, etc.).
- Outlet size (high, medium, low).
4. Visualizing Data:

Use multiple chart types:
 - Donut Charts for analyzing sales by fat content.
 - Bar Charts for total sales by outlet type.
 - Line Charts for tracking sales trends over years.
 - Matrix Charts for detailed sales by item type or outlet.
5. Creating Clear Visuals:
- Ensure all charts and visuals are labeled clearly.
- Use colors that are visually appealing and aligned with Blinkit branding.
6. Arranging and Formatting the Dashboard:
- Organize charts and KPIs in a user-friendly layout.
- Maintain consistency in font sizes, colors, and styling.

Step 5: Insights Generation

After assembling the dashboard:
 - Analyze the visualizations to derive insights.
- Identify trends in customer preferences.
- Assess which products and outlets are performing well.
- Evaluate customer satisfaction based on average ratings.

Step 6: Reporting
Finalize the dashboard:
- Review functionality to ensure all interactive elements operate correctly.
- Prepare a report that summarizes key insights and findings from the dashboard.
- Offer this report to stakeholders to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
